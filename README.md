Iâ€™ve been driving trucks for 30+ years. As a member of the U.S.Army, I learned how to collaborate as a team member and the value of being reliable. I have a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.  I am eager to learn and help an organization with their security needs.

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join an organization as an Entry level Cybersecurity Analyst, eventually joining a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst while continuing to learn.
